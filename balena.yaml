  The video-surveillance application is a collection of blocks and other third-party containers to create a 
state-of-the-art video surveillance system. At the foundation of this app is the [Kerberos.io 
Agent](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent), which is a cutting edge modular video surveillance system, made 
available as Open Source under the MIT License, with a strong focus on user experience, scalability, 
resilience, extension and integration. The idea of this app is to include more blocks over-time to improve and 
include new functionalities.
  
  # At the core: Home Assistant

  Open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first. Powered by a worldwide community of 
tinkerers and DIY enthusiasts. Perfect to run on a Raspberry Pi or a local server.
  
  ## The most important features

  - [Home Assistant Client](https://www.home-assistant.io)
  - [Read dconz community README](https://github.com/deconz-community/deconz-docker#readme) Serial BT UART 
must be swapped to GPIO.

```flow
wifi=>start: wifi-spot
net=>operation: Wifi network (wifi-box)
cond=>condition: Device connected ?
cond2=>condition: Gateway found ?
hb=>operation: Homebridge Hue Plugin
zb=>end: Light bulb on/off

wifi->net->cond->hb->cond2
cond(yes)->hb
cond(no)->net
cond2(yes)->zb
cond2(no)->hb
```

  ### How to run this app

  Simple click on the Deploy button, and create or use an existing fleet. Once done you can download the
